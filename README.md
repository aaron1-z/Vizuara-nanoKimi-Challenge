# Vizuara-nanoKimi-Challenge
nanoKimi: A Minimalist Implementation of a Kimi-K2-Inspired Architecture

This repository contains the source code and analysis for nanoKimi, a minimal, single-file implementation of a Kimi-K2-inspired transformer. This project was completed as a submission for the Vizuara Research Wing Research Challenge.

The goal of this project was to replicate the educational and accessible philosophy of Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT by building the simplest possible code for training and finetuning a Kimi-K2-style model.

Key Architectural Features Implemented

nanoKimi deviates from the standard transformer architecture by implementing two core features inspired by the Kimi-K2 model:

Latent Attention: To break the O(nÂ²) computational and memory bottleneck of standard self-attention, this model uses a fixed-size array of learnable latent vectors as an information bottleneck. This reduces the complexity to O(n * L), where n is the sequence length and L is the number of latents, making it highly efficient for long contexts.

Mixture of Experts (MoE): The standard feed-forward network (FFN) in each transformer block is replaced by a set of parallel "expert" networks. A trainable gating network routes each token to the top-k most relevant experts. This allows the model to have a very large number of parameters while keeping the computational cost per forward pass constant.

How to Run

This project is designed for simplicity and can be run in a standard Python environment with PyTorch. A Google Colab notebook with a T4 GPU is highly recommended.

Benchmark Results: nanoKimi vs. nanoGPT

Both models were trained for 5000 iterations on the TinyShakespeare dataset using identical core hyperparameters (n_layer=6, n_head=6, n_embd=384) on a Google Colab T4 GPU.

Analysis of Results

The benchmarking revealed a fascinating and critical insight into the trade-offs of modern transformer architectures.

nanoKimi Demonstrates Superior Generalization: The primary finding is that nanoKimi achieved a significantly lower (better) validation loss than the nanoGPT baseline (2.10 vs. 4.81). This suggests that its more complex architecture acted as a form of regularization, preventing the severe overfitting observed in the simpler model.

nanoGPT Suffers from Severe Overfitting: nanoGPT's extremely low training loss (0.13) compared to its high validation loss is a classic sign of memorizing the training data. While this allowed it to produce coherent-sounding text, it failed to generalize to unseen data.

Architectural Complexity vs. Data Scale: Despite its better validation score, nanoKimi failed to learn the high-level linguistic structures necessary to generate coherent text. This suggests that its advanced features (MoE, Latent Attention) require a much larger and more diverse dataset to be trained effectively. On this small-scale task, the architecture was under-utilized.

Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of key Kimi-K2 features in an accessible format. The benchmark results highlight that there is no universally "better" architecture; performance is highly dependent on the scale of the data and the specific task. nanoKimi's design shows promise for preventing overfitting and scaling to large contexts, while nanoGPT remains a powerful and efficient baseline for smaller datasets.
